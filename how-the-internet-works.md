# 🌐 How the Internet Works

## 1. What is the Internet?

The internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate through standardized protocols.

## 2. How a Website Loads in Your Browser

1. You type a URL like `www.google.com`.
2. The browser checks the DNS (Domain Name System) to get the IP address.
3. It sends a request to the server using HTTP/HTTPS.
4. The server sends back the HTML/CSS/JS files.
5. Your browser renders it as a website.

## 3. Key Components

- **Client**: Your browser or app.
- **Server**: A computer hosting the website.
- **DNS**: Like the internet’s phonebook.
- **IP Address**: Like a house address for websites.
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Protocols for communication.
